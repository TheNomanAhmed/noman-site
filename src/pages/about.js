          I have been in the field of graphic design for 6 years and worked with some great clients and startups. As my background is from Electrical and Computer engineering, I have always been keeping myself updated with latest digital technologies and tried learning them. I also have a strong set of skills in programming which helped me to learn front-end development. 
Besides from my technical background, I have always enjoyed working on the design aspects of different applications. I love using Adobe tools and made myself familiar with Photoshop, Illustrator and Adobe XD.  
Currently I find myself understanding the human computer interaction and human centered design {" "}

The aim is to boost client profits through improved attraction and retention of ideal customer bases.
